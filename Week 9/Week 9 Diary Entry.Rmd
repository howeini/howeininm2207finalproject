## What is the topic that you have finalized?

Answer: My finalized topic is on music. I plan to present a data story on the popularity of songs in different regions of the world based on the song attributes (e.g. danceability / energy / key / mode / loudness / speechiness / acousticness / instrumentalness / liveness / valence / tempo), genres and artists etc.
 
## What are the data sources that you have curated so far?

Answer: I will be using [this Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelexa/spotify200) found on Kaggle. Since the data set is rather large, I will be using Radiant to filter data extracted during 2022 only. I will also be removing some variables e.g. collab / source / previous rank / pivot, that I have deemed irrelevant to my data story.
