Matrix Between Total Streams and Attributes\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTotal streams appears to have the strongest positive correlation with valence and danceability, and the strongest negative correlation with mode and acousticness. This means songs that often carry a timeless vibe, fall into the Minor scale, radiate positive energy, are great for dancing, and maintain a balance with less acoustic sound.\n\n## Short-term Popularity\n\n### Understanding Short-term Popularity\n\nShort-term popularity is analyzing rank changes. A negative value indicates a rise, while a positive value signals a fall in the charts. The magnitude of the integer reflects the extent of the change. We also examine peak rank and weeks on the chart for a comprehensive view of short-term popularity dynamics.\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\nRank change is calculated by subtracting the previous rank from the current rank. It's important to note that a lower rank is better, with 1 being the highest!\n:::\n\n#### Correlation Matrix\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-corrst .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"plotly

Matrix Between Change in Rank, Peak Rank, Weeks on Chart and Attributes\n:::\n:::\n\nEnergy and loudness show the most significant negative correlation with rank change. Danceability has the most substantial negative correlation with peak rank. Acousticness exhibits the most notable positive correlation with weeks on the chart. In short-term popularity, lively and loud songs tend to drop in rank less, while danceable tunes aim for higher peak positions. Additionally, songs with acoustic qualities often stay longer on the charts.\n:::\n\n## Comparing Global and Local Trends\n\n<iframe height=\"500\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://howeini.shinyapps.io/WorldMap/\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n-   Does release_date have any influence?
