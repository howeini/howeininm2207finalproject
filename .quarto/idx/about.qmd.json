Across communities worldwide, music stands as a unifying force, transcending differences and fostering a shared connection among people.\n\n### **Unlocking Music in Business and Communication**\n\nBeyond its cultural significance, music holds *hidden potential*, particularly in the realms of business and communication. Unraveling the factors shaping song popularity offers artists and marketers invaluable insights into audience preferences. This understanding enables the creation of content that resonates deeply with diverse communities. From a communication perspective, popular songs act as poignant reflections of collective sentiments, encapsulating societal moods, highlighting emerging trends, and embodying cultural shifts.\n\n### **From Data to Narratives**\n\nThe question we're answering today is: [**what factors shape the popularity of songs in today's diverse music landscape?**]{.underline} Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details, let's kick things off with a panoramic overview of the music landscape as of January 2022.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n*This analysis draws from Spotify's 'Weekly Top Songs' charts, encompassing both individual countries and the global scene throughout January 2022.

They work together to create the diverse and colorful world of music, making each song distinct and captivating in its own way. Here is a description of the song attributes used in this data set:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe source for these attributes' descriptions can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features).\n:::\n\n| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Acousticness     | A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Danceability     | How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Duration         | The song duration in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Energy           | Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Instrumentalness | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. 'Ooh' and 'aah' sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly 'vocal'. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.                                                                                                     |\n| Key              | Represents what key the song is in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Liveness         | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Loudness         | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values typically range between -60 and 0 dB. The more negative the value, the louder the song is.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Mode             | Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a song, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Speechiness      | Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |\n| Tempo            | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece. This is directly derived from the average beat duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Valence          | Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n: Description of Song Attributes {.striped .hover}\n\nWith this knowledge, it's your turn to explore the interface below and uncover thesong attribute distributions!\n\n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://howeini.shinyapps.io/AttributeDist/\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nIn the overarching melody of January 2022, prevailing songs boast the following characteristics:\n\n-   Danceable\n-   Exhibiting Moderate to High Energy\n-   Sparse in Speech Elements\n-   Leaning towards Non-acoustic Tones\n-   Highly Probable Vocal Presence\n-   Unlikely to be a Live Performance\n-   Balancing Positive and Negative Vibes\n-   Resonating in the C♯/D♭ Key\n-   Harmonising with the Major Scale\n-   Settling into a Standard Volume Range\n-   Showcasing a Varied Pace\n-   Clocking in at Approximately 3 Minutes in Length\n:::\n\n## Exploring Popularity Dynamics\n\nTo delve into the intricacies of song popularity, our analysis unfolds along the lines of long-term and short-term dynamics.\n\n### Understanding Long-term Popularity\n\nLong-term popularity is gauged by a song's total streams throughout January, encompassing all charts.

Valence, reflecting the positivity of a song, consistently influences rank changes positively and correlates with a higher peak rank.\n  </span>\n</div>\n```\n### Summary\n\nIn both the long and short term, 3 main attributes consistently influence a song's popularity: **danceability, energy, and valence**. Generally, songs that are energetic, positive, and danceable tend to perform well.\n\nHowever, when it comes to enduring popularity over the long term, additional factors like **mode, acousticness, and instrumentalness** become significant. Specifically, songs in minor keys or featuring more instrumental elements are considered \"timeless,\" suggesting a lasting appeal that goes beyond current trends.\n\n## Comparing Global and Local Trends\n\nStudying local trends is essential in helping us understand what people love in different places, making the music experience more personal and relatable for everyone.\n\nThe following analysis focuses on the 3 identified attributes that impact how popular songs become: **danceability, energy, and valence**. In **Asia**, people have a lower preference for songs that are easy to dance to. The **energy** level varies a lot across different places, indicating no clear local trends. In terms of **valence**, **Canada** consistently leans towards super positive tunes.\n\n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://howeini.shinyapps.io/WorldMap/\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n## Decoding Musical Success: Final Insights\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"insights\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:1em;\"> What factors shape the popularity of songs in today's diverse music landscape? </span>\n</div>\n```\n\\\nAs seen in [Exploring Popularity Dynamics], a song's success ultimately involves an intricate interplay between global proclivities and localised nuances. The consistent sway of danceability, energy, and valence over a song's trajectory, be it in the short or long term, is undeniably significant. This holds profound implications for artists and marketers seeking resonance with diverse audiences. Moreover, the identification of songs in minor keys or enriched with instrumental elements as possessing a timeless quality speaks to the transcendence of these compositions beyond transient trends, reflecting the collective sentiment of society.\n\nThe comparative analysis of global and local trends offers intriguing insights. Notably, the lower preference for highly danceable songs in Asia and Canada's strong affinity for positive songs sparks questions about the influence of culture and values on musical tastes and preferences.\n\nWhile the intricacies of song popularity are undoubtedly multifaceted, this analysis aspires to offer a thought-provoking perspective on the dynamic interplay of musical elements that resonate with audiences worldwide.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Harmony Across Culture: The Essence of Music\n\nMusic, a universal language, intricately weaves itself into the very fabric of diverse societies, becoming a profound expression of culture.

Here is a description of the song attributes used in this data set:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe source for these attributes' descriptions can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features).\n:::\n\n| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Acousticness     | A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Danceability     | How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Duration         | The song duration in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Energy           | Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Instrumentalness | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. 'Ooh' and 'aah' sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly 'vocal'. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.                                                                                                     |\n| Key              | Represents what key the song is in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Liveness         | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Loudness         | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values typically range between -60 and 0 dB. The more negative the value, the louder the song is.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Mode             | Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a song, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Speechiness      | Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |\n| Tempo            | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece. This is directly derived from the average beat duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Valence          | Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n: Description of Song Attributes {.striped .hover}\n\nWith this knowledge, it's your turn to explore the interface below and uncover thesong attribute distributions!\n\n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://howeini.shinyapps.io/AttributeDist/\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nIn the overarching melody of January 2022, prevailing songs boast the following characteristics:\n\n-   Danceable\n-   Exhibiting Moderate to High Energy\n-   Sparse in Speech Elements\n-   Leaning towards Non-acoustic Tones\n-   Highly Probable Vocal Presence\n-   Unlikely to be a Live Performance\n-   Balancing Positive and Negative Vibes\n-   Resonating in the C♯/D♭ Key\n-   Harmonising with the Major Scale\n-   Settling into a Standard Volume Range\n-   Showcasing a Varied Pace\n-   Clocking in at Approximately 3 Minutes in Length\n:::\n\n## Exploring Popularity Dynamics\n\nTo delve into the intricacies of song popularity, our analysis unfolds along the lines of long-term and short-term dynamics.\n\n### Understanding Long-term Popularity\n\nLong-term popularity is gauged by a song's total streams throughout January, encompassing all charts. Songs with enduring appeal possess what we might call \"timeless\" attributes --- characteristics we seek to unearth in our analysis.\n\nExplore the tabs below to unfold the correlation and feature importance analyses, which can help you analyse the relationship between total streams and song attributes!\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Correlation Matrix\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe correlation coefficient has 2 important features:\n\n-   **Sign (positive/negative):** Positive correlation indicates that as attribute value increase, the total streams of the song tend to follow suit.

Danceability emerges as a central factor, positively impacting rank changes and peak rank, and showing influence on weeks spent on charts. Energy follows closely, demonstrating positive correlations with rank changes and peak rank, and significant importance for extended chart presence. Valence, reflecting the positivity of a song, consistently influences rank changes positively and correlates with a higher peak rank.\n  </span>\n</div>\n```\n### Summary\n\nIn both the long and short term, 3 main attributes consistently influence a song's popularity: **danceability, energy, and valence**. Generally, songs that are energetic, positive, and danceable tend to perform well.\n\nHowever, when it comes to enduring popularity over the long term, additional factors like **mode, acousticness, and instrumentalness** become significant. Specifically, songs in minor keys or featuring more instrumental elements are considered \"timeless,\" suggesting a lasting appeal that goes beyond current trends.\n\n## Comparing Global and Local Trends\n\nStudying local trends is essential in helping us understand what people love in different places, making the music experience more personal and relatable for everyone.\n\nThe following analysis focuses on the 3 identified attributes that impact how popular songs become: **danceability, energy, and valence**. In **Asia**, people have a lower preference for songs that are easy to dance to. The **energy** level varies a lot across different places, indicating no clear local trends. In terms of **valence**, **Canada** consistently leans towards super positive tunes.\n\n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://howeini.shinyapps.io/WorldMap/\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n## Decoding Musical Success: Final Insights\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"insights\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:1em;\"> What factors shape the popularity of songs in today's diverse music landscape? </span>\n</div>\n```\n\\\nAs seen in [Exploring Popularity Dynamics], a song's success ultimately involves an intricate interplay between global proclivities and localised nuances. The consistent sway of danceability, energy, and valence over a song's trajectory, be it in the short or long term, is undeniably significant. This holds profound implications for artists and marketers seeking resonance with diverse audiences. Moreover, the identification of songs in minor keys or enriched with instrumental elements as possessing a timeless quality speaks to the transcendence of these compositions beyond transient trends, reflecting the collective sentiment of society.\n\nThe comparative analysis of global and local trends offers intriguing insights. Notably, the lower preference for highly danceable songs in Asia and Canada's strong affinity for positive songs sparks questions about the influence of culture and values on musical tastes and preferences.\n\nWhile the intricacies of song popularity are undoubtedly multifaceted, this analysis aspires to offer a thought-provoking perspective on the dynamic interplay of musical elements that resonate with audiences worldwide.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"filters":["shinylive"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
