<p>Long-term popularity is gauged by a song’s total streams throughout January, encompassing all charts. Songs with enduring appeal possess what we might call “timeless” attributes — characteristics we seek to unearth in our analysis.</p>

<p>The correlation coefficient has 2 important features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sign (positive/negative):</strong> Positive correlation indicates that as attribute value increase, the total streams of the song tend to follow suit. Conversely, a negative correlation signals a decline in total streams as the attribute value rises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnitude (value):</strong> Values closer to 1 (or -1) represent stronger correlations.</p></li>

<p>Total streams appears to have the strongest positive correlation with valence and danceability, and the strongest negative correlation with mode and acousticness. This means songs that often carry a timeless vibe, fall into the Minor scale, radiate positive energy, are great for dancing, and maintain a balance with less acoustic sound.</p>

<p>Short-term popularity is analyzing rank changes. A negative value indicates a rise, while a positive value signals a fall in the charts. The magnitude of the integer reflects the extent of the change. We also examine peak rank and weeks on the chart for a comprehensive view of short-term popularity dynamics.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>Energy and loudness show the most significant negative correlation with rank change. Danceability has the most substantial negative correlation with peak rank. Acousticness exhibits the most notable positive correlation with weeks on the chart. In short-term popularity, lively and loud songs tend to drop in rank less, while danceable tunes aim for higher peak positions. Additionally, songs with acoustic qualities often stay longer on the charts.</p>
