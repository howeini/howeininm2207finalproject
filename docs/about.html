<ul>
<li>Short-term popularity is analysed by taking rank minus previous rank. Since 1 is the highest ranking, a negative integer would indicate that the song has risen up in the charts while a positive integer would indicate a fall in ranking. The value of the integer would indicate the extent of change i.e.&nbsp;larger integer implies greater change.</li>
<li>Will also be examining peak rank and weeks on chart</li>
